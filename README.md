# FarmerFoxChickenGrain

This project uses basic artificial intelligence concepts to solve the following riddle:

  A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of grain across a river. 
  He has a rowboat, and it can only carry him and one other thing.
  If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken.
  If the chicken and the grain are left together, the chicken will eat the grain.

  Get the farmer, fox, chicken and grain across the river.
